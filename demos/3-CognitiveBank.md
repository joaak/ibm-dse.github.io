Cognitive Bank is experiencing higher customer churn. They want to reduce churn by offering customers special deals that will improve their satisfaction. However, to reduce loss in revenue, they only want to target those specific customers which are most likely to churn. 

Using a combination of IBM Watson and IBM Machine Learning, they are able to rapidly and accurately analyze, model, and operationalize customer churn prediction. The intelligence is then integrated into their customer-facing website to give customers a personalized, celebrity experience that ultimately reduces churn.
