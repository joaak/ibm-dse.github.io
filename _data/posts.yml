  excerpt: "Data has intrinsic value to the enterprise, but how to quantify these data assets has been a struggle for many organizations and for many enterprises as they establish modern data practices and data organizations. In most organizations, data in and of itself doesn’t have intrinsic value. The data’s value emerges only after we build platforms for data science."

  excerpt: "Data Scientists are compared to Unicorns, a rare and mythical creature with great powers. While one can find folks with machine learning skills, it’s extremely rare to find one who’s also a domain expert with a tremendous understanding of the business. The business landscape is changing fast today. One example is retail, an industry that is seeing tremendous disruption due to the shift from brick-and-mortar to online buying. Machine learning is heavily used in this industry to augment the customer buying experience with individualized just-in-time cross-sell and up-sell offers. Let’s walk through a retail use case. We’ll start by identifying the business problem and then we’ll use data science to find a solution."

  excerpt: "In the connected world of today’s digital economy, apps, IoT devices, vehicles, appliances and servers are generating endless stream of event data. Event data is typically in small size per event but streams in at high speed generating huge volumes over time. The stream of events describes what is happening over time and offers the opportunity to track and analyze things as they happen. With access to complete sets of event data, businesses can derive critical insights from comprehensive analysis on all the data."

  excerpt: "Can you read fast? Really, really fast? As you start reading this blog, consider that a person reads an average page of text in about 2 minutes, so it could take you about 10 minutes to read this whole post, more or less. Now imagine reading 10 to 20 pages of a scientific paper. Next imagine reading hundreds, thousands, or even millions of such papers. Not an easy — if even feasible — task for a single person or even for a group of avid readers. And even if a group of people can read many scientific publications in a reasonable time, how would they then combine their acquired knowledge and establish correlations between articles and terms of interest, find common patterns related to a specific subject, and so on?"

  shortlink: https://ibm.co/IML_Multicloud
  excerpt: "More and more cloud-computing experts are talking about “multicloud”. The term refers to an architecture that spans multiple cloud environments in order to take advantage of different services, different levels of performance, security, or redundancy, or even different cloud vendors. But what sometimes gets lost in these discussions is that multicloud is not always public cloud. In fact, it’s often a combination of private and public clouds. As machine learning (ML) continues to pervade enterprise environments, we need to understand how to make ML practical on multicloud — including those architectures that span the firewall. Let’s look at three possible scenarios."

  excerpt: "Data Science is a team sport. While I’m not sure where this phrase was coined, it is an accurate phrase. This must be ringing true with enterprises as well since we often get the question: “What should the structure of a data science team be?” and “Where should a data science team report into?” The first question is probably a little more straight forward and that is what we will address here. The answer to the second question really is it depends on your organizations maturity in this space, but is should be some sort of federated or hub and spoke model eventually. Breaking down what is required to successfully execute a data science project and acknowledging that very few individuals possess all these skills helps to define what a team should look like. "

More often than not, aligning with existing expectations is a necessary step as you build consensus for data science to transform the organization."

  excerpt: "Companies have been sold on the alchemy of data science. They have been promised transformative results. They modeled their expectations after their favorite digital-born companies. They have piled a ton of money into hiring expensive data scientists and ML engineers. They invested heavily in software and hardware. They spend considerable time ideating. Yet despite all this effort and money, many of these companies are enjoying little to no meaningful benefit. This is primarily because they have spent all these resources on too much experimentation, projects with no clear business purpose, and activity that doesn’t align with organizational priorities."

  excerpt: "Forking a DSX project in GitHub creates a greater separation between users and allows for a more flexibility in merging assets. A greater separation allows DSX users to commit to their linked GitHub repository frequently without immediately impacting other users of the project. Assets are merged between users explicitly using GitHub pull-requests and can only be done when and if the owner(s) of the repository agree. Solving merge conflicts can be performed outside of DSX, either on GitHub or using any of the available Git tools on your local workstation."
